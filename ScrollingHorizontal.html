      One of the first people to walk down the aisle of lane ten that day was an elderly woman with a cart full of groceries. I went through my <br>
      normal routine of cleaning down the belt and apologizing for the wait.<br><br>

      “Sorry about that, we’re just trying to keep everything clean. How are you?”<br><br>

      “I’m good, how are you?”<br><br>

      “Good; just trying to keep everything clean, keep things moving.”<br><br>

    	We continued to chat as I scanned and bagged her groceries. Eventually, we came to talking about her granddaughter. The woman said that she <br>
      hadn’t been able to see her 18-month-old granddaughter during the heightened social distancing measures, which was especially hard given that <br>
      the woman usually watched her granddaughter while the girl’s parents were at work. She talked about how hard it had been to go from seeing her <br>
      granddaughter for ten or more hours a day to only over the occasional Facetime. The woman said that whenever they did videochat, her granddaughter <br>
      seemed more confused and upset than anything, and would cry “grandma!” at the screen, confused at why her caretaker wasn’t there in person.<br><br>

    	But she was more worried about her grandson. He had been brought to the hospital for a severe case of dehydration. She, of course, was not allowed to <br>
      visit him, as the hospital was trying to keep family members out of the Emergency Room to slow the spread of the virus. Her worried expression turned <br>
      to one of frustration.<br><br>

      “This would all go away if people would just do what they're supposed to.”<br><br>

    	I agreed, bagged the remainder of her groceries, and gave her a receipt. The quick transition between grandmotherly concern and grandmotherly anger <br>
      stuck with me. I only hoped that she would get to see her grandkids again soon.

      A while later, a man came down my aisle with a cartful of groceries. He looked to be stocking up for a while. I scanned some meat, boxes of macaroni, <br>
      and a couple boxes of cereal.<br><br>

      “Do you have kids at home?”<br><br>

      “Two. They’re going nuts.”<br><br>

	    We traded stories about boys (his sons, my brothers,) stuck at home making trouble and neglecting their online school. I scanned four one-and-a-half-gallon <br>
      jugs of water on the bottom of his cart. I asked about his Rick and Morty shirt, prompting a conversation about the most recent episodes of the show. As I <br>
      was scanning a loaf of bread and we were chatting about the upcoming May 3rd Rick and Morty release, my manager walked by. Something on the floor seemed to <br>
      catch her eye, and she walked over to me.<br><br>

      “You do know that there's a two-item-per-guest limit on water, right?” she asked me. I had completely forgotten that water products were part of the pandemic <br>
      shopping limitations, as I had primarily had to enforce the 1-item limit on paper products. She apologized to the man and reclaimed two of the water jugs as I <br>
      deducted the jugs from his total.<br><br>

      Not particularly knowing how to behave now that my manager had just taken two of his waters, I continued bagging the man’s items and making the occasional small <br>
      talk. I mentioned that I was from Colorado, and he told me about how he’d always wanted to live in the mountains. As my manager walked by again, he raised his <br>
      voice a tad and said “it just sucks that my family of four only has ten gallons of water to drink for the week.” It wasn’t at all related to our conversation, <br>
      so I was taken aback. After she had passed, he just continued our conversation as if nothing had happened. He fuddled with the card machine for a minute or so. <br>
      (The reader is finicky sometimes.) I gave him his receipt and wished him luck keeping his kids occupied during social distancing. He thanked me and went on his way.<br><br>
